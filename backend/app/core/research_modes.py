Research Mode Configuration - Single source of truth for research depth settings.

Defines three research modes with different top_k values and prompt enhancements:
- Quick (7 sources): Fast, focused answers
- Enhanced (12 sources): Balanced depth with multiple perspectives
- Deep Research (16 sources): Exhaustive scholarly analysis
